        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ryan Byunghun Cho, and I am currently an 18 year old first-year college student at the University of California Riverside. I am originally from Northridge, California, where I grew up my entire life. My family is from South Korea until they moved here at a young age to find new opportunities. Without a college education, my parents were able to succeed and provided me a life where I couldn't ask for more. Today, my goal is to bring a bigger success to my family's name in order to keep my parents from working and give them everything they need and more.<br><br>

        I am currently studying Pre-Business as I one day plan on owning my own business. My parents have owned multiple businesses and have given me inspiration and motivation to follow in their footsteps on owning a business, even if it would be a different type of business. My parents mainly focused on their Korean BBQ restaurants, something that brought success to our family. Seeing how they worked and what they did to attract customers was interesting to me. I have also worked a job at Blaze Pizza for almost a year. As I had a close relationship with my manager, I was able to ask many questions about how the busisness world works and what it takes to succeed. Previously playing basketball throughout all 4 years of highschool, I attempted to reach a goal of playing Division I basketball. Playing basketball taught me how to work hard for what you want, and even though I am not playing basketball anymore, it still gave me many life lessons that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Basketball gave me the opportunity to use my work ethic for the future and my profession. <br><br>

        As I am not too sure on which branch of business I want to pursue, I believe my experience at UCR will give me the opportunity to do so. The many clubs and courses available at my school allows me to explore my options and figure out what I'd really want. So far, the marketing side of business has really intrigued me. More specifically, I believe I have the potentional to succeed in Social Media Marketing. At a young age, I resold sneakers and made a profit off of it for a couple years. I would have to learn how to grow my Instagram Page and learn how to get consistent customers. Looking back, marketing and learning how to attract an audience was a fun experience for me. During my time in college, I plan on looking for internships involving social media marketing, giving me the chance to learn everything in that area, and allowing me to succeed when the time comes to either get a job or even create my own business. While I am currently taking business courses as well, I have the opportuinty to gain knowledge about the businesss world beyond marketing in order to understand what I need to do.
